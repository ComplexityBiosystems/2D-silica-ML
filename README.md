# Code for the paper 'Predicting the failure of two-dimensional silica glasses'

The present folder contains some example codes that we have exploited for the study of mechanical properties of silica 2D with machine learning techniques:

- The folder 'silica-dataset-generation' contains the code for generating our dataset which comprehend silica atomic configurations and images
- The folder 'Silica-SVM' contains the code for SVM application to silica configurations
- The folder 'Silica-CNN' contains the code to train the convolutional neural networks for the predictions of silica mechanical properties
- The folder 'Silica-Grad-CAM_Silica' contains some examples of the application of the Grad-CAM technique

Each folder contains a README file which states the system requirements and the instructions for installing and running the code.
